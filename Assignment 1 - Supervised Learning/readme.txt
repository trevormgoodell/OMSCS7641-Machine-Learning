To run the code, all the should need to be done is clone the repo, uncomment/comment the experiments you don't want to / want to run in experiments.py, and then run the experiments.py file. It will overwrite the current files/images in the directory structure if they are there, if not you will need to make sure that the file structure, as shown below, exists.

The repo can be found here: https://github.com/trevormgoodell/OMSCS7641-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Assignment%201%20-%20Supervised%20Learning
